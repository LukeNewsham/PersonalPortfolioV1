            <h2> Summary of my journey so far... </h2>
            <p>
                I graduated with a First Class Architecture Degree in 2020 from The University of Nottingham, followed by a years work at a respected Architecture firm. <br><br>

                However, I soon realised the proffesion didnt help me to proggress my long-term aspirations anymore.<br> <br>

                I researched and explored other careers, and very quickly bounced back to programming after a taster from GCSE. It was clear coding would give me the freedom to design, the challange to keep me engauged, and the chance to make a difference. <br><br>
                
                Today, I am learning the skills required to become a software developer. I am so excited to see where this new path takes me!
